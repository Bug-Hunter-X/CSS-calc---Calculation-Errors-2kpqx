The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected layout or rendering issues.  Specifically, when using `calc()` with percentages and other units, it can lead to errors if the order of operations or unit types aren't precisely defined. For example, using a space between the operator and the value may cause the browser to misinterpret the expression. Also, mixing percentages with fixed units without careful consideration of the context can produce unexpected outcomes.
